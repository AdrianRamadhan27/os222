## WEEK 00
1. [How Do Operating Systems Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjNp0bBrjmU) - ClickView (YouTube)<br>
A good brief introduction for understanding what OS is. Has cute animations to accompany you with. Explains a little about the history of computer operating systems. Best one to start with, in my opinion.

2. [Introduction of Operating System â€“ Set 1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-operating-system-set-1/) - GeeksforGeeks<br>
A 5-10 minutes read about OS concept. Described about the definition and its functions. Explains it in conceptual view very well. Also discussed some of the components of an OS and examples of OS. If you want a quick read, this is a good option.

3. [Introduction to Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBURTt97EkA) - Neso Academy (YouTube)<br>
This video is actually more of a lecture/course video rather than an informative one. If you want to start making notes for future purposes I recommend you to watch this video. Don't make this your first reference for OS as it will be very sleep-inducing. 

4. [Linux in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrB13utjYV4) - Fireship (YouTube)<br>
Will summarize the Linux OS in a blink of an eye. A good gateway for next week's subject. You might want to slow the video speed down while the Linux commands are being listed, though. 


## WEEK 01
1. [Linux Commands with Examples](https://www.javatpoint.com/linux-commands) - JavaTPoint<br>
In my opinion, the best way to learn Linux commands are from reading, not watching a video. Helps you keep up at your own pace. This site will help guide you through **50 commands** (don't have to necessarily learn all of them) and give you usage examples of it. A good cheatsheet if you struggle to memorize the commands.

2. [10 Linux Terminal Commands for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpTfQ-q6MPU&) - Gary Explains (YouTube)<br>
Don't feel like learning 50 commands? Don't worry, watch this video and learn the essential commands you can start with. After that, maybe go back to the first link. I recommend you to just watch and pay attention to the video and practice later after finished watching it as it could be quite a challenge to keep up. 

3. [Basics of VI editor in under 8 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_DvfdgR-LA) - LabIT (YouTube)<br>
A hidden gem of a video. Best way to learn Vi editor is through immediate demonstration. This guy gets straight to the point so just follow what he's doing step by steps.

4. [Learn Regular Expressions with simple, interactive exercises](https://regexone.com/lesson/) - RegexOne<br>
Best site to learn Regex (other than the video provided in [vslm.org](https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/Welcome2GNULinux.html). It will help explain each pattern and gives you an exercise to go along with it. You don't have to complete the whole lesson, you can finish as you've got a clearer picture about Regex.

5. [you need to learn BASH Scripting RIGHT NOW!!](https://youtu.be/SPwyp2NG-bE?t=219) - NetworkChuck (YouTube)<br>
Start the video at the timestamp (3:39). Pretty good demonstration about bash scripting. The guy on the video is very enthusiastic on explaining it will help cheer you up :). He not only demonstrates but also added his own notes so you can understand better.

6. [Git It? How to use Git and Github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdAHXoRtos&) - Fireship (YouTube)<br>
You might have already learned this in PBP but nonetheless here's a good video about git commands and github. Will give you a good grasp on using git.

7. [Learning GitHub - How to Write MarkDown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJojC3lSkwg) - Prof3ssorSt3v3 (YouTube)<br>
Lastly, you should learn how to write markdown files. Wondering how this site is written? Well, the answer to that is in this video. Good lesson for PBP as well.
