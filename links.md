## WEEK 00 ‚ù§
1. [How Do Operating Systems Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjNp0bBrjmU) - ClickView (YouTube)<br>
A good brief introduction for understanding what OS is. Has cute animations to accompany you with. Explains a little about the history of computer operating systems. Best one to start with, in my opinion.

2. [Introduction of Operating System ‚Äì Set 1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-operating-system-set-1/) - GeeksforGeeks<br>
A 5-10 minutes read about OS concept. Described about the definition and its functions. Explains it in conceptual view very well. Also discussed some of the components of an OS and examples of OS. If you want a quick read, this is a good option.

3. [Introduction to Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBURTt97EkA) - Neso Academy (YouTube)<br>
This video is actually more of a lecture/course video rather than an informative one. If you want to start making notes for future purposes I recommend you to watch this video. Don't make this your first reference for OS as it will be very sleep-inducing. 

4. [Linux in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrB13utjYV4) - Fireship (YouTube)<br>
Will summarize the Linux OS in a blink of an eye. A good gateway for next week's subject. You might want to slow the video speed down while the Linux commands are being listed, though. 


## WEEK 01 üß°
1. [Linux Commands with Examples](https://www.javatpoint.com/linux-commands) - JavaTPoint<br>
In my opinion, the best way to learn Linux commands are from reading, not watching a video. Helps you keep up at your own pace. This site will help guide you through **50 commands** (don't have to necessarily learn all of them) and give you usage examples of it. A good cheatsheet if you struggle to memorize the commands.

2. [10 Linux Terminal Commands for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpTfQ-q6MPU&) - Gary Explains (YouTube)<br>
Don't feel like learning 50 commands? Don't worry, watch this video and learn the essential commands you can start with. After that, maybe go back to the first link. I recommend you to just watch and pay attention to the video and practice later after finished watching it as it could be quite a challenge to keep up. 

3. [Basics of VI editor in under 8 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_DvfdgR-LA) - LabIT (YouTube)<br>
A hidden gem of a video. Best way to learn Vi editor is through immediate demonstration. This guy gets straight to the point so just follow what he's doing step by steps.

4. [Learn Regular Expressions with simple, interactive exercises](https://regexone.com/lesson/) - RegexOne<br>
Best site to learn Regex (other than the video provided in [vslm.org](https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/Welcome2GNULinux.html)). It will help explain each pattern and gives you an exercise to go along with it. You don't have to complete the whole lesson, you can finish as you've got a clearer picture about Regex.

5. [you need to learn BASH Scripting RIGHT NOW!!](https://youtu.be/SPwyp2NG-bE?t=219) - NetworkChuck (YouTube)<br>
Start the video at the timestamp (3:39). Pretty good demonstration about bash scripting. The guy on the video is very enthusiastic on explaining it will help cheer you up :). He not only demonstrates but also added his own notes so you can understand better.

6. [Git It? How to use Git and Github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdAHXoRtos&) - Fireship (YouTube)<br>
You might have already learned this in PBP but nonetheless here's a good video about git commands and github. Will give you a good grasp on using git.

7. [Learning GitHub - How to Write MarkDown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJojC3lSkwg) - Prof3ssorSt3v3 (YouTube)<br>
Lastly, you should learn how to write markdown files. Wondering how this site is written? Well, the answer to that is in this video. Good lesson for PBP as well.

## WEEK 02 üíõ
1. [Introduction to Cybersecurity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULGILG-ZhO0) - CBT Nuggers (YouTube)<br>
This video will give you a few ideas about cybersecurity. Some concepts are explained descriptively with illustrations. Won't cover all, however. If you want to finish the whole course check out the [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVJk9oC5JKq15cieChuOU9zFdf-FlnMi) as well.

2. [System Security](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-security/) - GeeksforGeeks <br>
If you don't have the time or energy to read the Silberschatz slides, this article will pretty much summarize it for you. Once again, GeeksforGeeks is a good website for you to learn anything Computer Science related. 

3. [Encryption and public keys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-JjHa-qLPk) - Khan Academy (YouTube)<br>
Another concept you should learn is encryption. This should cover everything about encryption including symmetric vs asymmetric encrytion. This video is edited nicely with graphical illustrations to prevent you from getting bored unlike just some slide presentations. 

4. [Free Interactive C Tutorial](https://www.learn-c.org) - Learn C<br>
This is a good website for basic C programming and even advanced topics like pointers as well. If you don't think reading is going to help you memorize C syntax, don't worry. This site also provides an exercise for you to finish.

## WEEK 03 üíö
1. [Files & File Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN8YgJnShPM) - CrashCourse (YouTube)<br>
Good introduction about files and file systems. Has illustrations to help you understand the basic concepts. Won't cover much but should be a good start for this week's subject.

2. [File Systems in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-systems-in-operating-system/) - GeeksforGeeks<br>
Still going strong with GeeksforGeeks. Pretty much summarized chapter 13, 14, and 15 of Silberchatz. Also check out the next few articles ([Structures of Directory in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/structures-of-directory-in-operating-system/), [File Allocation Methods](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-allocation-methods/?ref=lbp),[Free space management in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/free-space-management-in-operating-system/)).

3. [Linux File System/Structure Explained!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbgzrKJvDRw) - DorianDotSlash (YouTube)<br>
This one specifically focus on Linux file systems so not only is it important for this week's subject it also should help you understand more how to use VirtualBox for future weeks.

## WEEK 04 üíô
1. [Operating Systems 2 - Memory Manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdkxXygc3rE) - OpenCanvas (YouTube)<br>
This video will explain in brief about few memory management schemes. If you had questions about memory in operating systems before, this video will more than likely answer it.

2. [Paging | Memory Management | Operating System](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi8jtyHv8D6AhXx8DgGHZrTAbwQFnoECE8QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gatevidyalay.com%2Fpaging-memory-management-operating-system%2F&usg=AOvVaw2WD79q768m2XbpqcinL936) - GateVidyalay<br>
Trying to switch things up a bit this time. Just so you know, GeeksForGeeks has complete source for this week's subject as well. But since I've referenced it too much this time I'll use an alternative. This site has a good explanation about paging and memory management in general.

3. [Pointers in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw1qsMieK5c) - Gary Explains (YouTube) <br>
If the tradition stands, this week's QUIZ02 shall test you on C pointers. Not only is this video a great help for that, it should also give you an understanding about pointers in general. 

## WEEK 05 üíú
1. [Operating System - Virtual Memory](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_virtual_memory.htm) - TutorialsPoint <br>
This article just like GeeksForGeeks sums up the Silberschatz chapter 10 slide. If you don't have time to study for QUIZ 01 of WEEK 5 this should be a great help. It explains the advantages of virtual memory, what demand paging is, page replacement, FIFO, and LRU. Only missing explanation about copy-on-write.
2. [Copy on Write](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/copy-on-write/) - GeeksForGeeks <br>
Since the first link didn't cover COW. This should be its complementary read. Mind you, Copy-on-Write is a very important concept that you should understand and remember in order to answer quiz questions or Mr. RMS' questions in class (no more "Moshi moshi?").
3. [Endianness in C | Big Endian vs Little Endian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9lVoThjV7o) - TechVedas .learn (YouTube) <br> 
You probably have already learnt this concept in PSD and POK, but just in case forgot or still couldn't grasp the concept this video is a good explanation for you. It's specifically in C so it should also help you with Quiz 2 of WEEK5. 


## WEEK 06 ü§é
1. [What is a Process in an Operating System?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLwMl9qK4T8) - Visual Computer Science (YouTube) <br>
Underrated video with not enough views. Before I watched this video I had trouble understanding the concepts of Process and its lifecycle. This video should be a good opener before you delve into the harder concepts of this week. 
2. [What is Process Scheduling?](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-scheduling) - studytonight <br>
This article is definitely a must-read. It explains briefly and about scheduling queues, scheduler types, context switch and also a good intro to the next topic which is operations on process which are creation and termination. You can also read the full article package/course on this website which is more than enough for you to understand this week's subject.
3. [Fork, exec, wait and exit system call explained in Linux](https://vitux.com/fork-exec-wait-and-exit-system-call-explained-in-linux/) - VITUX  <br>
This article will explain more about process scheduling specifically  in Linus/C that is used by processes. Some of the syscalls here are very important to understand and remember.  After reading this article don't forget to try the W6 demos and/or previous midterms. Definitely will be a big help.
4. [Multithreading vs. Multiprocessing: What's the Difference?](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/multithreading-vs-multiprocessing) - indeed <br>
Moving on to the topic of threads, this article has a great explanation about multithreading and multiprocessing. Not only that, this article also provides the benefits and drawbacks of each. 


## WEEK 07 üñ§
1. [Unix Processes in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cex9XrZCU14&list=PLfqABt5AS4FkW5mOn2Tn9ZZLLDwA3kZUY) - CodeVault (YouTube) <br>
This is a really good playlist to learn processes. The guy on the videos will go in depth through every concept and he has such a nice way of explaining them.
2. [Introduction of Deadlock in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-deadlock-in-operating-system/?ref=lbp) - GeeksForGeeks <br>
It's been a while so I'll continue referring GFG again. Just like previous subjects, these collection of articles will sum up the contents of Silberschatz chapter 8 and honestly easier to understand.
3. [How to Use SCP Command to Securely Transfer Files](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-scp-command-to-securely-transfer-files/) - Linuxize <br>
For a linux newbie myself I was dumbfounded when week07 assignment requires you to copy from a local system to a remote system. But this article helped me understand how. Also, try WinSCP but you'll need to get your ssh public key.

## WEEK 08 ü§ç
1. [CPU Scheduling Algorithms - Operating Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiVKIdGheEU&list=PLIY8eNdw5tW_lHyageTADFKBt9weJXndE) - Simple Snippets (YouTube) <br>
For me, understanding the algorithms for CPU scheduling such as FCFS, SJF, RR, etc are better with straight up demonstration just as how it is explained in class. In case you missed it, this playlist has the best videos explaining each of the CPU Scheduling Algorithms in detail.

2. [Multiprocessors Scheduling in Operating System](https://www.javatpoint.com/multiple-processors-scheduling-in-operating-system) - javaTpoint <br>
Unfortunately, I couldn't find any good videos when it comes to multiprocessor scheduling or thread scheduling. So a quick search on google will give you this article that is pretty clear in my opinion in explaining the concepts. 

3.[LFS 11.2 Package Mirrors](https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/lfs/lfs-packages/11.2/) - OSU Open Source Lab <br>
As long as you follow step by step from [Kernotex](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyc5xVO2uDsDlbR_LTP37nG6g4vbSSxSZ)'s playlist, you most likey won't run into any problems for WEEK08 Assignments. But 1 issue I ran into was some packages in the wget-list are not available to download because newer versions are out. In order to get the proper package required for md5sums to clear you can download them from this archive.
