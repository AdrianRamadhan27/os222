## WEEK 00
1. [How Do Operating Systems Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjNp0bBrjmU) - ClickView (YouTube)<br>
A good brief introduction for understanding what OS is. Has cute animations to accompany you with. Explains a little about the history of computer operating systems. Best one to start with, in my opinion.

2. [Introduction of Operating System – Set 1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-operating-system-set-1/) - GeeksforGeeks<br>
A 5-10 minutes read about OS concept. Described about the definition and its functions. Explains it in conceptual view very well. Also discussed some of the components of an OS and examples of OS. If you want a quick read, this is a good option.

3. [Introduction to Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBURTt97EkA) - Neso Academy (YouTube)<br>
This video is actually more of a lecture/course video rather than an informative one. If you want to start making notes for future purposes I recommend you to watch this video. Don't make this your first reference for OS as it will be very sleep-inducing. 

4. [Linux in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrB13utjYV4) - Fireship (YouTube)<br>
Will summarize the Linux OS in a blink of an eye. Will be a good gateway for you for next week's subject. You might want to slow the video speed down while the Linux commands are being listed, though.
